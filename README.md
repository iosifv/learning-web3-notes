## My personal journey ##

- 2022.05.26 
  - Amazing video on [How to become a Smart Contract Engineer in 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFjeWP148jM&ab_channel=SmartContractProgrammer). This contains youtube and twitter accounts to follow, w
    - direct link to the [Coggle map](https://coggle.it/diagram/YCzP1lR6dWF3jfas/t/ethereum-smart-contract-engineer-2021) from the video
- 2022.05.28
  - Started following these 2 tutorials from Patrick Collins: [What is a DAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_QKZzd68ro) and [How to build an on-chain DAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhJtmUqhAqg)
- 2022.05.31
  - Finished folowing the video and created scripts on the previously mentioned tutorial from Patrick
  - I keep getting an error on function ```deployGovernorContract``` : ```cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit``` so because of this I Can't actually do a ```yarn hardhat deploy```
  - I went through this other cool video collection [Hardhat Tutorials | NFT OpenZeppelin ERC721](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw-9a9yL-pt3sEhicr6gmuOQdcmWXhCx4)
  
## My first steps to bootstrap this new field ##

This will contain links or descriptions of what I did ordered by the actual timeline I did these things in:
- Started following Patrick Collins on this video: [Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ)
- Amazing practical explanation with increasing complexity of what the blockchain is [here](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash)
- I followed this guide here from Dries Buytaert [My first web3 webpage](https://dri.es/my-first-web3-webpage)
  - signed up for [fleek](https://app.fleek.co/)
  - created a new [Github repository](https://github.com/iosifv/iosifv.eth) and set up automatic deployment with Fleek
  - started using [Owlracle](https://owlracle.info/eth) to keep track of Ethereum gas prices and to make blockchain transactions when they are the lowest
  - created a new Ethereum wallet and transfered some funds 0x2807DcEB543909a9173Df3c3Cb703f9447e6b771
  - used [ENS.domains](https://app.ens.domains/name/Iosifv.eth/details) to buy iosifv.eth
  - created a small webpage that I saved on IPFS through Fleek
  - Experimented with pointing the content of iosifv.eth to an IPNS so that I can update my static website whenever I want 
    - failed miserably: I understood that this is not possible with the current ENS setup?
  - pointed the content record to a simple [IPFS resource](ipfs://bafybeigdnxri7qeqpmkwxgh6o7fzwhk4nto3ztqwx33dmmowvzizlcw74a/) aand it works
- Finally decided to set up a test network 
  - *Log in to places using Ledger through Metamask on Brave browser !!! important!!!* other combinations tend to fail
  - Used a tap to get some eth and buy iosifv.eth for 20 years on Ropstein network
- Started lessons on [CryptoZombie](https://cryptozombies.io/en/)
  - Finished chapters: Solidity Path, Chainlink Path, Advanced Solidity Path

    - used [MintNFT.today](https://mintnft.today/) to mind an NFT (ERC-1155) on Polygon
    - Spent ages "finding" it - discovered it can be seen under the hidden tab in OpenSea

    - Created a new Phantom wallet (Metamask equivalent) and [attached my Ledger account](https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/4406388670483-How-to-use-your-Ledger-Nano-hardware-wallet) to it.
    - Started snooping around on [HowRare](https://howrare.is/drops) based on a TikTok I saw...
    - Found [AsciiPunk](https://asciipunk.com/) a collection of 10k NFT's which look like the crypto punks but are made with ascii characters. First 7500 are supposed to be free, the last 2500 are 0.05 SOL. I managed to buy 3 of them but from the latter paid tier
