# Web3 Learning Journey #

This repository contains valuable web3 resources I personally used or simply just found and bookmarked.

### What is in here? ###

This contains any kind of Tutorials / Tools / Resources that I found. 

## My personal journey ##

This will contain links or descriptions of what I did ordered by the actual timeline I did these things in:
- Started following Patrick Collins on this video: [Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ)
- Amazing practical explanation with increasing complexity of what the blockchain is [here](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash)
- I followed this guide here from Dries Buytaert [My first web3 webpage](https://dri.es/my-first-web3-webpage)
  - signed up for [fleek](https://app.fleek.co/)
  - created a new [Github repository](https://github.com/iosifv/iosifv.eth) and set up automatic deployment with Fleek
  - started using [Owlracle](https://owlracle.info/eth) to keep track of Ethereum gas prices and to make blockchain transactions when they are the lowest
  - created a new Ethereum wallet and transfered some funds 0x2807DcEB543909a9173Df3c3Cb703f9447e6b771
  - used [ENS.domains](https://app.ens.domains/name/Iosifv.eth/details) to buy iosifv.eth
  - created a small webpage that I saved on IPFS through Fleek
  - Experimented with pointing the content of iosifv.eth to an IPNS so that I can update my static website whenever I want 
    - failed miserably: I understood that this is not possible with the current ENS setup?
  - pointed the content record to a simple [IPFS resource](ipfs://bafybeigdnxri7qeqpmkwxgh6o7fzwhk4nto3ztqwx33dmmowvzizlcw74a/) aand it works
- Finally decided to set up a test network 
  - *Log in to places using Ledger through Metamask on Brave browser !!! important!!!* other combinations tend to fail
  - Used a tap to get some eth and buy iosifv.eth for 20 years on Ropstein network
- Create an NFT
  - Signed up properly on OpenSea [opensea/iosif](https://opensea.io/iosifv)
  - used [MintNFT.today](https://mintnft.today/) to mind an NFT (ERC-721) on Polygon
  - used [MintNFT.today](https://mintnft.today/) to mind an NFT (ERC-1155) on Polygon
  - Spent ages "finding" it - discovered it can be seen under the hidden tab in OpenSea
