## My personal journey ##

This will contain links or descriptions of what I did ordered by the actual timeline I did these things in:
- Started following Patrick Collins on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ
- Amazing practical explanation with increasing complexity of what the blockchain is https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash
- I followed this guide here from Dries Buytaert https://dri.es/my-first-web3-webpage
  - signed up for https://app.fleek.co/
    - created a new github repository and set up automatic deployment
  - started using https://owlracle.info/eth to keep track of Ethereum gas prices and to make blockchain transactions when they are the lowest
  - created a new Ethereum wallet and transfered some funds 0x2807DcEB543909a9173Df3c3Cb703f9447e6b771
  - bought iosifv.eth
  - created a small webpage that I saved on IPFS
  - Experimented with pointing the content of iosifv.eth to an IPNS so that I can update my static website whenever I want - failed miserably
  - pointed that to a simple IPFS resource ipfs://bafybeigdnxri7qeqpmkwxgh6o7fzwhk4nto3ztqwx33dmmowvzizlcw74a/ aand it works
- Finally decided to set up a test network 
  - *Log in to places using Ledger through Metamask on Brave browser !!! important!!!* other combinations tend to fail
  - Used a tap to get some eth and buy iosifv.eth for 20 years on Ropstein network
- Create an NFT
  - Signed up properly on OpenSea https://opensea.io/iosifv
  - used https://mintnft.today/ to mind an NFT (ERC-721) on Polygon
  - Spent ages "finding" it - discovered it can be seen under the hidden tab in OpenSea
-  

## Todo ##
- mint an NFT on Ethereum Testnet on Opensea
- try to link the opensea NFT to the ens domain
